# 🧱 Intermediate-Level Git Practice  
Hello there! 👋  
If you’ve made it to this folder, congrats — you’ve already survived `git add .` and `git commit -m "final version FINAL"` 😅

This is where things start to get a bit more real. Welcome to the **intermediate stage** of my Git learning journey. It’s messy, fun, and occasionally dangerous (looking at you, `reset --hard`).

## 💻 What’s This Folder About?

This repo is all about practicing Git commands that go beyond the basics. It includes:

- Creating, switching, and deleting branches (without fear)
- Merging and rebasing (like a DevOps Jedi)
- Undoing mistakes without panicking
- Using stash like a backpack for lost code
- Tagging like you mean it 🎯

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites

To get the most out of this folder, you should:

- Know basic Git stuff: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`
- Be comfy in a terminal (no need to be a wizard, but typing `ls` shouldn't scare you)
- Ideally be on **Linux** or WSL — because that’s where the real DevOps life begins 🐧

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These commands can (and will) break things if you're not careful. Especially stuff like:
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`

So please don't blame me if your code goes poof. Git teaches hard lessons, but good ones.

## 🧪 Try, Fail, Repeat

The best way to learn Git is to mess things up and figure out how to fix them.  
That’s exactly what this folder is for.

Happy Gitting! ✌️
